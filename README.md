# LWIR.cpp

Lightweight intermediate representation generator.
Do you need a quick intermediate representation, but don't want to setup an entire MLIR dialect?
LWIR might be the solution for you!
(You definitly don't want to use this for anything serious, go use MLIR for that, I hear its really good.)

IRs are specified in a python script which generates a C++ header:

```python3
lwir(
    template_path = "arith.tmpl.hpp",
    output_path = "arith.hpp",
    ir = IR(
	insts = [
            Inst("Add",
                args=[Arg("a"), Arg("b")],
                type="a->type()",
                type_checks=["a->type() == b->type()"]
            ),
            Inst("ConstInt",
                args=[Arg("value", Type("int"))],
                type="Type::Int" 
            )
	],
    ),
    plugins = [
        InstPlugin([
            InstGetterPlugin(),
            InstWritePlugin()
        ]),
	BuilderPlugin()
    ]
)
```
